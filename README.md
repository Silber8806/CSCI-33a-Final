##App Name
Name: CompareRate
Allows a user (login) to list commonly held non-commercial liabilities: student loan, 
mortgage and credit card debt and analyze repayment/interest rate changes to see the
impact on overall cashflow.  Part of the app will pull in information on say Zillow 
about house prices/mortgage statistics and I will also list common costs associated 
with these loans: eg closing costs, repair costs, origination fees. 


##Milestones
When it comes to app development, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect.
And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.


##Good Milestone:
User Login using flask-login, section for analyzing houses and maybe pull in some Zillow data. 
Start with a single type of debt.  Allow the user to list multiple liability accounts.


##Better Milestone
All the above, but add high level summary dashboard of financial situations.


##Best Milestone
Add section for financial transactions eg paychecks and purchases so that a person can see 
how their cashflow is being impacted by said loans.


##Skills to learn:
Call Zillow API and integrate it.  Learn flask-login and possibly flask-forms.  
Possibly learn how to use SQL-Alchemy with flask.  Not 100% sure.  I'm really interested 
in personal finance and so want to build an app around it in some way.
