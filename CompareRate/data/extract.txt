# download open addresses database...find CSV file for a city (we use cambridge here) and run bash like the below:
cat city_of_cambridge.csv | tail -n+2 | awk -F ',' '{print $1","$2","$3" "$4", Cambridge, Ma"}' > cambridge_ma.csv

#use SQLite Browser client to load data into a table called cambridge_ma_stage using import table from CSV button (or importer)
#addresses found here...http://results.openaddresses.io/

# run the following in SQLite Browser client:
insert into houses_zipcodes(
	'longitude',
	'latitude',
	'street',
	'city',
	'state'
)
select
	field1,
	field2,
	field3,
	field4,
	field5
from cambridge_ma_stage
where field6 is not null

# lost 1 row due to a null being in the field... thought it would be fine as this is a demo...  Took it out of the CSV.
